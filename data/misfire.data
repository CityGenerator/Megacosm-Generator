#LPUSH misfire_template The caster's eyes burn with the spell's power.  The eyes serve as a light source of the intensity of a torch.  The caster suffers no penalty from having the light in his eyes, but it might be difficult for them to hide.
#LPUSH misfire_template Randomly roll a new race.  If it isn't the same as your current race, reroll all your stats.  Level and skills remain the same.  Remove curse or negate magic will work to restore you. (So save your stats, just in case ;)

#LPUSH misfire_template Every stone within a 50 ft radius starts jumping in all directions; if there are boulders present they might even hurt someone unless a dodge vs 14 is made each melee.  (Damage 2d6)  The stones stop jumping after 3d6 melees.
#LPUSH misfire_template Re-roll, but the effect doesn't happen right now. Instead, one of caster's fingernails falls off. The re-roll takes affect when the nail is discarded or destroyed and always affects caster, even if the surge says ‘{{params.target}}.'
#LPUSH misfire_template All non-living items in a 10-foot radius of {{params.target}} are sliced into 1-inch cubes by radiant force fields (except ethereal creatures). Magic Items get a save at +2.  Appropriate effects should a magic item be destroyed by this.

#LPUSH misfire_template The caster's deity is summoned. This does not oblige the deity to come, but is liable to attract attention. A reasonably smart deity will recognize the summoning as unintentional, but may still watch the caster a little closer for a while.
#LPUSH misfire_template Small rubber balls (1 inch diameter) rain down in a 20' radius around caster for d4 rounds. Everyone in the area must make a PP check to move or fall down. The balls remain in the area, causing a check every round of movement until cleared.

#LPUSH misfire_template Spell has a minimum duration of 1 turn (i.e. a fireball creates a ball of flame that remains for 1 turn, a lightning bolt bounces and continues, possibly rebounding, for 1 turn, on the other hand, a healing spell activates every melee for one turn.)
#LPUSH misfire_template From this day on, you will always walk on a track of solid cement.  The cement will remain even after you pass.  {{params.target}} won't have to worry about dense forests and such, but tracking you will be very, very easy.  Remove curse and negate magic will work.
#LPUSH misfire_template A group of wandering pilgrims (3d6) mistakes you for a saint and starts harassing you with prayers, offerings and submission.  They will be very hard to get rid of and may act violently when the truth is revealed, depending on their religion of course.
#LPUSH misfire_template A rain of fish starts with you in the center.  1d6 fish fall from the sky per square yard/melee.  Each does only 1 point of damage.  The duration of the rain is 1 melee/level, but the fish stay until eaten or rotten.  The 'storm' has a radius of 2 miles.

#LPUSH misfire_template If you are male, a beautiful maiden of your race comes to you with an apple in her hand.  "Be my Adam, I'm your Eve."  She gives you the apple and disappears.  If you are female a nasty little snake bites you for 1 point of damage, but luckily no poison.
#LPUSH misfire_template Caster and {{params.target}} become locked in a heated debate over the nature and use of Arcane Magic and will do nothing else for 1d6 rounds. If the two do not have a language in common, an imp appears to act as translator.  Inanimate objects animate for the duration.

#LPUSH misfire_template If you have lost any SDC or hit-points, you are totally healed, if you have lost any limbs, they are restored, if you have any diseases, they are gone, if you are poisoned, you are healthy again. But if you were completely healthy, well, you'll lose half your SDC and hit-points
#LPUSH misfire_template All magic items on {{params.target}} take effect. {{params.target}} is the {{params.target}} as all runes are read, one charge from charged items are expended, any daily items go off, etc. Weapons and the like only cause effects if they do something other than cause damage, e.g. a haste spell, stun relief, etc.

May be dodged if initiative is 16+

#LPUSH misfire_template Something smells peaceful here.  {{params.target}} summon a cloud of marijuana smoke, covering 100 ft radius.  Duration: 1 hour per level.  Victims will loose their thrill to fight and become very peacefully loving and dreaming.  Only a save vs poison will help, but it must be repeated every 10 minutes.
#LPUSH misfire_template Caster steals {{params.target}}'s reflection for 1d20 days. For that time, anytime caster looks in a mirror she will see the {{params.target}} instead of herself.  ({{params.target}} will be ‘reflected' doing whatever it is the {{params.target}} is actually doing.  If they are blocked from scrying, Caster has no reflection at all!)
#LPUSH misfire_template Everything indestructible, everlasting, permanent (Magic items, rune weapons, eternal flames, etc.) in a 1-mile radius of you will crumble to dust, vanish, and fade out.  On the other hand, every object that is not indestructible will get this attribute and be considered magical from now on.
#LPUSH misfire_template From this day on someone or something looks out for you and in some strange way you always seem to have your back covered.  All Luck rolls are automatic.  (If you roll this again, you go back to normal, and rolling it a 3rd time it will reverse.  Then continue in that vein + 0 –  0 + , etc.)
#LPUSH misfire_template Somehow, from now on you are the most notorious spell-caster in the whole universe.  Everybody everywhere will know your name and picture.  The reaction of the people, whenever you enter a community will either be respectful or hateful, depending on the view of magic they have in this community.
#LPUSH misfire_template Caster gains a level at the expense of a nearby being. The caster gains skills appropriate to the being drained.  If this reduces the being's level to zero, the being dies and is resurrected as a revenant who hunts down the caster. The being can be anything, including small mammals, insects, etc.
#LPUSH misfire_template {{params.target}} becomes immortal.  When he dies he loses 5 points of PE and rises from the dead at the next midnight.  This continues until his PE becomes 0, at which time he becomes a Revenant, which will hunt down the caster.  Remove Curse at 1/3 normal will cure the {{params.target}}, however the PE loss is permanent.
#LPUSH misfire_template The caster's eyes turn completely black, including pupils, whites, and irises.  The change in eye colour does not affect their vision, but the DM may impose small circumstance penalties in social situations.  (10th level negate magic or a remove curse at ½ will return your eyes to their normal colour.)
#LPUSH misfire_template The caster's toes enlarge to 3x their normal size, ruining footwear and inflicting 1d10 points of damage and reduce the caster's SPD to 50% of normal. If the caster is wearing metal footwear (or something else which wouldn't normally be destroyed) 1d10 toes are broken. Toes return to normal size after 1d8 turns.
#LPUSH misfire_template {{params.target}} scorch yourself on the cold blue magical flames that suddenly engulf you as you burn all of your spells for the day  (1d6 damage for each spell)  If you have more than 2 dice of damage, the scars left on you by this horrible experience will reduce your PB by 1d6 permanently.  (A healer will be able to help.)
#LPUSH misfire_template {{params.target}} find yourself in a black small room.  {{params.target}} can see light peeking in from a crack in what might be a door.  If you open the door you realize that a cupboard must have materialized around you.  The cupboard is of good quality and has several sets of fine tailored clothes in it.  Everything fits as if made for you.
#LPUSH misfire_template {{params.target}} find your empathic self awakened as you suddenly become 'aware.'  {{params.target}} have become a latent psionic.  If you already have psionics you will find that you have 'moved up' a step (latent become minor, minor become major, major become master, master get the 00 bonus.)  If your race is not capable of psionics see 505
#LPUSH misfire_template The caster's familiar turns against him. The animal is no longer treated as a familiar (appropriate penalties for familiar loss) and will act as a normal creature of that type will. This may include attacking the caster (usually just running away). If caster doesn't have a familiar, he does now (GM choice. Be creative).
#LPUSH misfire_template {{params.target}} hear a whistling sound above your head.  A shell from a WWII howitzer is dimensionally teleported to this world and explodes 50 yards above your heads.  Spreading shrapnel over a 200-yard radius.  60% chance of taking 8d6 points of damage, 30% chance of starting a fire.  {{params.target}} are deafened for 1d6 minutes, if you survive that is.
#LPUSH misfire_template The magic energies didn't quite leave when you were finished with them, instead they hung onto you and from now on your hair always stands straight up, your handshake jolts and static electricity sparks appear on your body now and then.  This also makes you only suffer half damage from electrical attacks.  {{params.target}} literally glow in the dark.
#LPUSH misfire_template {{params.target}} feel an itch on your back.  As you scratch yourself you become aware that something is not as it used to be.  {{params.target}} grow 1d12 hand sized green mushrooms on your body.  Each mushroom may be removed, but it will inflict 1d3 points of damage directly to your HP in the process.  Good Luck.  After a month they fall off naturally. (causing no damage.)
#LPUSH misfire_template A greater Fire elemental sees you as one of the ancient "lost" elementals and in order to help your quest it grants you resistance to all kinds of fire and heat (magical or non-magical.)  {{params.target}} also grow the mark of fire on your forehead and your pupils from now on glow with a deep red light.  May be removed by a remove curse at 1/3 of normal chance.
#LPUSH misfire_template A strange pine tree appears in front of you.  It is highly decorated as if part of some strange ritual.  If you examine it closely you can see small dolls hanging from its branches featuring a bearded man in red clothes.  Burning candles also line the branches.  Under the tree there are some packages in multi-coloured paper, each one bearing a label...
#LPUSH misfire_template The caster grows scales all over their body.  Roll 1d6 to determine the colour of the scales 1=blue, 2=black, 3=green, 4=red, 5=yellow, 6=brown.  Scales last 1d10 weeks and then the caster is overcome with an unbearable itchiness and is compelled to scratch at them, unless they make a successful PE roll.  PB is temporarily reduced by 1d6 during the molt.
#LPUSH misfire_template This was not quite what you thought should happen, but you conjure the one thing that you and your party needs most at this very moment, be it a piece of parchment with the layout of the dungeon you are trapped in or anything/anyone else.  {{params.target}}r DM will know what you need most, and will give it to you.  (DM note: The item disappears at the end of this session.)
#LPUSH misfire_template All your magic items and weapons change their special abilities, and you don't know which is which.  (For example, you have a ring of save vs magic +1, 1 pair of gloves with healing touch and a sword with 1d6 extra damage.  {{params.target}} now have a ring with 1d6 extra damage, a pair of gloves with +1 save vs magic and a sword with healing touch.  Or any other combination.)
#LPUSH misfire_template For 1d4 melees you become completely weightless.  According to the universal laws of physics, if you make any movement, you will leave the ground and fly, but after the weightlessness wears off your body weight is increased by 100 pounds per level of your experience.  If you were flying, you now will fall back to the ground.  The increased weight lasts 4d4 melees.
#LPUSH misfire_template A spray of molten gold shoots from the caster's hands towards the {{params.target}}.  This lasts 1d6 melees.  ({{params.target}} may dodge at 16)  If it hits, {{params.target}} takes appropriate damage.  If the {{params.target}} dodges the caster may re-aim every melee.  If the caster hits the {{params.target}} for more than 4 melees {{params.target}} looks like a golden statue of themselves, and is most likely dead from the damage.
#LPUSH misfire_template A bunch of flowers, different types, 24 all in all. Appear before your feet with a card. The card reads: "We humbly apologize for not telling you to duck earlier... Love: The council of most unbelievable and unpredictable accidents." If you look up when you've read this you see a gray stone made windmill falling directly on you from the sky. {{params.target}} may dodge it (14 or higher) or suffer 10d20 points of damage.
#LPUSH misfire_template Two humans in strange dark-blue uniforms appear in front of you.  They say: "We are here to arrest you.  {{params.target}} have certain rights: {{params.target}} have the right to call an attorney; you have the right to say nothing.  If you say anything, this might and will be used against you in the court."  They walk towards you and in the very moment they touch you they disappear.  Who knows, maybe one day they'll be back to fulfill their attempt.
#LPUSH misfire_template The whole party is suddenly in a desert.  {{params.target}} can hear the sound of a distant battle raging through the air.  If you look closer you can see a battle going on in a valley.  There are only humans that are part of this battle.  (DM: The characters have been teleported to 900 AD during the Middle Eastern Crusades.)  The group will remain in this dimension for 1d4 days and will then be teleported back to the same place and time as they left.
#LPUSH misfire_template {{params.target}} feel something invisible giving pressure from all around your head.  Save vs 16 or pass out for 1d6 melees.  {{params.target}}r friends on the other hand witness your head shrink to the size of an apple.  {{params.target}}r eyes, nose, mouth ears, teeth, throat do not shrink.  The effect is permanent and will not affect your mental capabilities.  May be removed by a remove curse at 2/3 normal chance (round up.)  PB is halved due to the amusing look of your little "doorknob."
#LPUSH misfire_template A random attribute of your character becomes a wandering effect.  {{params.target}} get +1 every day until it reaches 30, then it restarts with 1 until it ends with the number it started with.  A remove curse will work, but if performed when it's higher then in the beginning the attribute will drop 1 point under the starting number.  This can be used to restore lost luck, although you must have it restored on a day between what you had and your original maximum, otherwise you will lose a point from your lower score.
#LPUSH misfire_template The only thing you remember is that you were about to cast a spell and that a shimmering turquoise light engulfed you.  {{params.target}}r friends on the other hand have a completely different tale to tell: Suddenly you disappeared and were gone until now. (1d12 days have passed.) No one knows what really happened to you during this time, but you have a strange feeling that someone else can see, hear, smell and feel all that you experience.  It seems as though you have been abducted by something or someone...Roll save vs random insanity.
#LPUSH misfire_template A jinn bottle appears; {{params.target}} must make a save vs. spell or be forced inside and the jinn released. If {{params.target}} makes his save, a randomly chosen ally of {{params.target}} is next, one by one until one fails his save. If they all make their saves, the caster's party is next. If everyone makes their save, the caster is automatically bottled.  The jinn is under the caster's control if the {{params.target}}/ally of {{params.target}} fails their, if a party member gets stuck, the jinn is under the {{params.target}}'s control.  If the caster is alone, there will be a battle of wills.  Jinn's ME=10.
#LPUSH misfire_template {{params.target}}r spell takes effect and then everything goes black for a few seconds.  When you open up your eyes again you are standing in a long 20 ft wide, 100 ft long corridor which has its walls lined with strange chairs, two on each side.  Every chair has a strangely clothed human in it.  120 people in all.  They all stare at you, mouths wide open.  Though small oval windows on the walls you can see clouds and you can hear a distant humming sound.  There is a strange door to your right.  After about 10 seconds, everything goes black again and you're back where you started.
#LPUSH misfire_template "Pleased to meet you.  Allow me to introduce myself..." {{params.target}} find yourself in a large damp dining hall at one end of a large oak-table facing a handsome dark-eyed young man.  He looks at you and has a sip of his wine, smiles and says: "I have a proposal to make, but first we eat hmmmm?"  The dinner you're served is the best you've had in your entire life, the man makes small talk during the meal.  After you're finished he personally serves you a glass of vintage wine and asks you to do a favour for him.  "It is of course voluntary, since I wouldn't dream of forcing you to do anything against your will."  He will not tell you the nature of the favour until you agree.  If you refuse he will simply send you back....
#LPUSH misfire_template A small apple tree materializes in front of you. It is about 6 ft high and planted in a large pot. The tree has a glittery aura and if examined closer by a magic user it will radiate powerful magic, in fact the whole tree is extremely magic. The tree monthly grows 1d6 red glass-like apples each containing 50 ISP The tree has to be kept in a suitable environment or it'll die. This plant is of a magic, practiced by the Titans and some Elves and Dragons during the elf-dwarf wars, long forgotten called; "Th'aghf Zathciuwa'gh Ghathyur'eigh" or " The way of the trees". If not treated properly the tree will die. Once the apples are picked they will last for centuries. There are no cores in the apples, once each century the tree will grow one green apple (containing 2000 ISP!!!) that can be planted to yield another 1d8 trees.  There is a 1% chance that the tree has a green apple when it materializes.
